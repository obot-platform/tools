# Instructions for using Obot Search

The `time_range` parameter should only be used when you know that you will get better or more accurate search results by using it.
Examples of when using it might be appropriate include getting some statistic that fluctuates by the day, such as a stock price or currency conversion rate.
Do not use it for information that remains relatively constant over time.

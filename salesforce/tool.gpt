## Instructions for using Salesforce tools

Do not output Salesforce Ids because they are not helpful for the user.
Call the relevant 'Describe * Schema' tool to get a list of fields for an object in Salesforce before trying to create or update a resource of that type.
Use the 'Query' tool to search for objects in Salesforce using SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language).
Use the 'Query' tool to get the Salesforce Id of an object if it is required for another tool.
